# Notes
## Clamping
_"The word **clamp** is used when we talk about keeping a particular value within a range of values or a specified set of values."_ (Dr. T)

Clamping just basically means maintain something within another something. For example, keep a game object within the screen so it doesn't get cut off so to speak.
