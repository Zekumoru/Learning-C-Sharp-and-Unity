# Visual Studio Unity Imports Error
If for some reason, Visual Studio cannot resolve unity imports, in other words, Visual Studio seems to not know them for whatever reason.

We can fix this by right-clicking `Assets` in the Project window on Unity, then select `Reimport All`.

> This has happened to me because I changed the project's unity version to a newer one.
